## 🤝 Contributing to Chronowriter

Welcome, creative builder! Chronowriter is a modular, emotionally supportive AI book platform — and we’re excited to have you join us. Whether you're fixing a bug, designing a new component, or expanding model orchestration, your contribution matters.

## 🧭 Philosophy

We build with:

- **Modularity** — Components should be reusable, composable, and beginner-friendly  
- **Emotional Safety** — Clear feedback, gentle UX, and supportive documentation  
- **Creative Flow** — Frictionless design, intuitive navigation, and remixable content

## 🧩 Component Guidelines

- Use **TypeScript** and **React Functional Components**  
- Style with **CSS Modules** or global variables  
- Keep components **modular and reusable**  
- Add **comments** for clarity and onboarding  
- Prefer **emotionally supportive microcopy** (e.g. “Remix your story” vs “Regenerate”)  

---

## 🧠 Model Contributions

If adding or updating model orchestration:

- Use **OpenRouter-compatible IDs**  
- Add fallback logic and error handling  
- Document model purpose (e.g. “Claude for tone calibration”)  
- Keep orchestration modular and swappable  

---

## 🧪 Testing & Feedback

- Test your feature locally  
- Ask for feedback if unsure — we value learning and collaboration  
- Celebrate small wins and share blockers openly

## 📚 Docs & Onboarding

Want to help others onboard faster?

- Add examples to the README
